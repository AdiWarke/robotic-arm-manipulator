Above repository contains all the necessary files such as launch files, urdf model and python scripts for a robotic arm manipulator.This repo is useful only if we want to simulate the robot and doesn't contain any code for actual hardware interfacing. For simulation I have used Rviz, Moveit and Gazebo. This project is a part of my journey of learning ROS2.
